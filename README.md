📝 To-Do List App (MERN Stack)

This project is a To-Do List web application built using the MERN Stack — MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks easily through a clean and responsive interface.

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate how the MERN stack can be used to build a full-stack CRUD application with seamless communication between the frontend and backend.

⚙️ Technologies Used

MongoDB – NoSQL database used to store the tasks.

Express.js – Backend web framework that handles API routes and middleware.

React.js – Frontend library for building the interactive user interface.

Node.js – JavaScript runtime used to build the backend server.
